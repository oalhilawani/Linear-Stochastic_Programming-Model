Implemented the simplex method in python prioritizing efficient coding and matrix handling. Coded the primal affine scaling algorithm in python, generating an initial feasible solution for optimized problem-solving.
Achieved a 100% code accuracy rate for both methods when compared to an industrial solver such as linprog function.
